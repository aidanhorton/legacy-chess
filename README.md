# legacy-chess
A legacy chess engine - because I haven't uploaded enough attempts already! I made this one quite a few years back - hence the legacy!

This one is missing a few features, and there's a few bugs, detailed below:
- In very rare cases it doesn't recognise check, or moves into check.
- If it doesn't see any threat, it simply usually moves a piece back and forth - it doesn't take initiative.
- You cannot castle.
- There is no En Passon
- You cannot change a pawn into another piece once you reach the end.
- Check mate is not visually shown to the user other than they are unable to move the king to any space.
- Probably some more stuff!

Seb, you can actually download an run this one unlike the others! ;)
